Welcome to the ESX Version of Tsunami Warning!

The script itself was originally written for the QBcore platform however this is a full conversion from QBcore to ESX (I have written permission from Strez to release this as we worked together to create an ESX version of his original script)

This script will allow cities to alert players of an incoming tsunami via their smartphone in-city, this allows players not to break character and head for safetey before a tsunami occurs.

This scipt relies heavily on txadmin restart notifcations & cd_easytime which is included as part of this package (we changed the tsunami from the HALLOWEEN affect to Thunder to make this more realistic)

Dependencies:
cd_easytime - https://github.com/dsheedes/cd_easytime
Compatible Smartphone for sending emails

Core Features

15 Minute Warning - Email & Weather Change (Thunder/Rain)
5 Minute Warning - Email Notification
1 Minute Warning - Email Notification
If this script for whatever reason does not work, I recommend that you join Strez discord where we will be able to help you diagnose the issue.
